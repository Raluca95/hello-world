  <h1>My favourite food</h1>
  <p>I don't love too many preparates,but one of them is a soup that we called <em>Ciorba Radauteana</em>.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 carrot</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>half of celery</li>
    <li>1 pepper</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>500 ml sour cream</li>
    <li>500 g chicken breast</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>condiments</li>

  </ul>
  <p>It depends on the taste of everyone who wants to add more to be more tasty.</p> 
  <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Wash vegetables and chicken breast and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>
We will only need the egg yolk, so break the egg and separate it. Add over the yolk, cream and a pinch of salt.</li>
    <li>If the vegetables are cooked and the chicken breast, remove from the water and cut into small cubes.</li>
    <li>From the water in which they boiled take a polonium and add over the cream mixed previously with yellow and salt.</li>
    <li>Over the soup formed, add the vegetables and the previously cut chicken breast plus the garlic scrape.</li>
    <li>Season to taste.</li>
    <li>Allow a few minutes to boil over low heat.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Now enjoy it!Make an awesome playting!</strong></p>
